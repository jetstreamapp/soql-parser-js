## [Unreleased]
### Changed
**!BREAKING CHANGES!**
- Added literal type information to fields to provide additional information about the field type. (#51)
  - WHERE clause fields have one of the following types `'STRING' | 'INTEGER' | 'DECIMAL' | 'BOOLEAN' | 'NULL' | 'DATE_LITERAL' | 'DATE_N_LITERAL';` stored in the condition.
  - For date literal fields that have variables, `dateLiteralVariable` will be populated with the value 
- Modified Field data structure to have explicit type information. (#46, #52)
  - The data structure for fields has been modified to include specific information about the structure of a given field to ease making sense of a parsed query,
  - To aid in creating compose fields, a new helper method is available - `getComposedField()`. This takes in a simple data structure (or even a string) and will return the structure needed to compose a query.

### New
- An additional `queryUtils` object is available with the following functions:
  - `function getComposedField(input: string | ComposeFieldInput): FieldType`
  - `function getFlattenedFields(query: Query, isAggregateResult?: boolean): string[]`
  - `function isSubquery(query: Query | Subquery): query is Subquery`
  - Look at the README and refer to the unit tests for example usage.
