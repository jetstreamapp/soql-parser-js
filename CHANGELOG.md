ðŸ’¥ Breaking Changes ðŸ’¥

Release 4.x has changed the way the `groupBy` and `having` clauses are parsed. (#149)
Previously, the `groupBy` clause only allowed multiple entries for fields, but not functions.

The `groupBy` and `orderBy` are now always returned as arrays from parsed queries to normalize the returned data structure.

For backwards compatibility, a single `groupBy` or `orderBy` object is allowed to be passed in to `composeQuery()`, but a parsed query will always return an array.

The `Query` object now has

- A list of group by clauses (a single groupBy clause is allowed if you build the data structure yourself)
- A Having clause (this was previously nested in the groupBy clause)
- A list of orderBy clauses (a single orderBy clause is allowed if you build the data structure yourself)

```diff
-groupBy?: GroupByClause;
+groupBy?: GroupByClause | GroupByClause[]; // a parsed query will always be undefined or an array
+having?: HavingClause;
orderBy?: OrderByClause | OrderByClause[]; // a parsed query will always be undefined or an array
```

Each groupBy clause

- No longer has a nested having clause
- Is an object with a single `field` or `fn` property

```diff
type GroupByClause = GroupByFieldClause | GroupByFnClause;

-interface GroupByOptionalFieldsClause {
-  having?: HavingClause;
-}

-interface GroupByFieldClause extends GroupByOptionalFieldsClause {
+interface GroupByFieldClause {
-  field: string | string[];
+  field: string;
}

-interface GroupByFnClause extends GroupByOptionalFieldsClause {
+interface GroupByFnClause {
  fn: FunctionExp;
}
```

Here are a few examples of how the `groupBy` is parsed or expected when composing a query:

`SELECT UserId, CALENDAR_MONTH(LoginTime) month FROM LoginHistory WHERE NetworkId != NULL GROUP BY UserId, CALENDAR_MONTH(LoginTime)`

```javascript
{
  fields: [
    {
      type: 'Field',
      field: 'UserId',
    },
    {
      type: 'FieldFunctionExpression',
      functionName: 'CALENDAR_MONTH',
      rawValue: 'CALENDAR_MONTH(LoginTime)',
      parameters: ['LoginTime'],
      alias: 'month',
    },
  ],
  sObject: 'LoginHistory',
  where: {
    left: {
      field: 'NetworkId',
      operator: '!=',
      literalType: 'NULL',
      value: 'NULL',
    },
  },
  groupBy: [
    { field: 'UserId' },
    {
      fn: {
        functionName: 'CALENDAR_MONTH',
        rawValue: 'CALENDAR_MONTH(LoginTime)',
        parameters: ['LoginTime'],
      },
    },
  ],
}
```

`SELECT ProductCode FROM Product2 GROUP BY ProductCode HAVING COUNT(Id) > 1 ORDER BY COUNT(Id) DESC`

```javascript
{
  fields: [{ type: 'Field', field: 'ProductCode' }],
  sObject: 'Product2',
  groupBy: [{
    field: 'ProductCode',
  }],
  having: {
    left: {
      operator: '>',
      value: '1',
      literalType: 'INTEGER',
      fn: { rawValue: 'COUNT(Id)', functionName: 'COUNT', parameters: ['Id'] },
    },
  },
  orderBy: [{
    fn: { rawValue: 'COUNT(Id)', functionName: 'COUNT', parameters: ['Id'] },
    order: 'DESC',
  }],
}
```

`SELECT SBQQ__Product__r.Name foo, SBQQ__Quote__c foo1 FROM SBQQ__Quoteline__c GROUP BY SBQQ__Quote__c, SBQQ__Product__r.Name`

```javascript
{
  fields: [
    {
      type: 'FieldRelationship',
      field: 'Name',
      relationships: ['SBQQ__Product__r'],
      rawValue: 'SBQQ__Product__r.Name',
      alias: 'foo',
    },
    {
      type: 'Field',
      field: 'SBQQ__Quote__c',
      alias: 'foo1',
    },
  ],
  sObject: 'SBQQ__Quoteline__c',
  groupBy: [{ field: 'SBQQ__Quote__c' }, { field: 'SBQQ__Product__r.Name' }],
}
```

## 3.2.0

March 27, 2021

A number of improvements to the formatter have been made with this release.

- The formatter option `whereClauseOperatorsIndented` has been deprecated and will always be applied.
- A new boolean formatter option named `newLineAfterKeywords` has been added and will ensure that there is always a new line after any keyword. (#137)
- `TYPEOF` fields will now always be included on their own line be default, or will span multiple lines, split by keywords if `newLineAfterKeywords` is set to true. (#135)

## Example

`SELECT Id, TYPEOF What WHEN Account THEN Phone, NumberOfEmployees WHEN Opportunity THEN Amount, CloseDate ELSE Name, Email END, Name FROM Event`

`formatOptions: { newLineAfterKeywords: true, fieldMaxLineLength: 1 },`

```sql
SELECT
  Id,
  TYPEOF What
    WHEN
      Account
    THEN
      Phone, NumberOfEmployees
    WHEN
      Opportunity
    THEN
      Amount, CloseDate
    ELSE
      Name, Email
  END,
  Name
FROM
  Event
```

## 3.1.0

March 27, 2021

1. Added support for the `FIELDS()` function

## 3.0.2

March 6, 2021

1. Date functions were not properly parsed when used in order by clauses. (#139)
2. Modified names of functions / types (internal)
3. Removed improper import of `isString` from node utils

Changes also released to 2.5.6

## 3.0.1

January 7, 20201

1. `getFlattenedFields` did not properly handle the alias for an aggregate function within an aggregate query. (#131)

## 3.0.0

October 14, 2020

ðŸ”¥ Breaking Changes ðŸ”¥

This version changes the `WHERE` clause structure when using the `NOT` operator t0 fix issue #122, and has implemented stricter type definitions.

The `NOT` operator is now treated as a `LogicalOperator` and will be set in the `operator` field between `left` and `right`.
In cases where this is populated, the preceding `left` condition will either be set to `null` or will at most have the `openParens` field populated.

The `logicalPrefix` property has been removed from `Condition`.

Example of the change in structure for queries using NOT - `SELECT Id FROM Account WHERE NOT Id = '2'`

```diff
{
  "fields": [
    {
      "type": "Field",
      "field": "Id"
    }
  ],
  "sObject": "Account",
  "where": {
-    "left": {
-      "logicalPrefix": "NOT",
-      "field": "Id",
-      "operator": "=",
-      "value": "'2'",
-      "literalType": "STRING"
-    }
+    "left": null
+    "operator": "NOT",
+    "right": {
+      "left": {
+        "field": "Id",
+        "operator": "=",
+        "value": "'2'",
+        "literalType": "STRING"
+      }
  }
}
```

If you are using Typescript in strict mode, you may encounter some breaking changes to your types depending on how you pre-checked for the presence of fields.

`Field` and `FieldRelationship` are now made up of two types, one with and one without alias.
`Condition` is now made up of multiple individual interfaces that represent different data types based on what data is populated.
`OrderByClause` is now made up of multiple individual interfaces that represent different data types based on what data is populated.
`GroupByClause` is now made up of multiple individual interfaces that represent different data types based on what data is populated.
`HavingClause` is now made up of multiple individual interfaces that represent different data types based on what data is populated.

Previously you could have just done null/undefined checks in Typescript strict mode.
Now, to avoid using the `any` type, you can use the newly introduced utility methods that provide type detection and type narrowing.

- `hasAlias()`
- `isFieldSubquery()`
- `isGroupByField()`
- `isGroupByFn()`
- `isHavingClauseWithRightCondition()`b
- `isNegationCondition()`
- `isOrderByField()`
- `isOrderByFn()`
- `isString()`
- `isSubquery()`
- `isValueCondition()`
- `isValueFunctionCondition()`
- `isValueQueryCondition()`
- `isValueWithDateLiteralCondition()`
- `isValueWithDateNLiteralCondition()`
- `isWhereClauseWithRightCondition()`
- `isWhereOrHavingClauseWithRightCondition()`

Here is a summary of the core changes, view the `Readme` for the comprehensive types.

```diff
export type FieldType =
   | Field
+  | FieldWithAlias
   | FieldFunctionExpression
   | FieldRelationship
+  | FieldRelationshipWithAlias
   | FieldSubquery
   | FieldTypeOf;
```

```diff
-export interface WhereClause {
-  left: Condition & ValueQuery;
-  right?: WhereClause;
-  operator?: LogicalOperator;
-}

+export type WhereClause = WhereClauseWithoutOperator | WhereClauseWithRightCondition;

-export interface Condition {

-  logicalPrefix?: LogicalPrefix;
-  field?: string;
-  fn?: FunctionExp;
-  operator: Operator;
-  value?: string | string[];
-  literalType?: LiteralType | LiteralType[]; // If populated with STRING on compose, the value(s) will be wrapped in "'" if they are not already. - All other values ignored
-  dateLiteralVariable?: number | number[]; // not required for compose, will be populated if SOQL is parsed
-}

-  right?: HavingClause;
-  operator?: LogicalOperator;
-}

+export type HavingClause = HavingClauseWithoutOperator | HavingClauseWithRightCondition;

```

## 2.5.3

April 24, 2020

1. Fixed nanoseconds on date (#102)

## 2.5.2

April 23, 2020

1. Added support for dates formatted with nanoseconds, such as `2020-04-15T02:40:03.000+0000`. (#102)

## 2.5.0

April 3, 2020

1. Passing in null or undefined to compose query no longer throws an exception, but instead returns an empty string. (#95)
2. Regular fields in a select clause now allow aliases because this is allowed if the field is used as part of a group by clause. (#97)
3. `getFlattenedFields()` now considers if a relationship field was used as part of a group by, and if so it returns just the field name instead of the entire field path, as this is how Salesforce will return the records. (#98)

## 2.4.1

Mar 22, 2020

1. Updated dependencies to resolve known security vulnerabilities.

## 2.4

Feb 25, 2020

1. Date literals were not properly parsed if they were included as part of a SET within a WHERE clause, such as `WHERE IN (TODAY, LAST_N_DAYS:5)`.
   1. As part of this change, the `dateLiteralVariable` property in the `Condition` will be an array if a variable date literal is included in a SET where clause. Refer to test cases `93` through `98` for examples

## 2.3.0

Jan 13, 2020

1. The `DESC` operator in the `ORDER BY` clause was treated as a case-sensitive field.
2. The following fields we treated as case-sensitive:
   1. `NEXT_N_FISCAL_QUARTERS`, `LAST_N_FISCAL_QUARTERS`, `N_FISCAL_QUARTERS_AGO`, `NEXT_N_FISCAL_YEARS`, `LAST_N_FISCAL_YEARS`,
   2. `mi`, `km` on `GEOLOCATION` functions
3. Updated the `DISTANCE` function to properly be tagged as `isAggregateFn=true` if used as a field
   1. This fixed an issue where `getFlattenedFields()` would throw an exception

Jan 4, 2020

1. Added logo to README and updated docs.

## 2.2.2

Dec 2, 2019

1. When composing a query, if an empty OrderBy array was provided, the composed query would still include the `ORDER BY` clause in the composed query.

## 2.2.1

Nov 17, 2019

1. `GROUP BY` did not allow multiple fields to be listed, for example: `SELECT BillingState, BillingStreet, COUNT(Id) FROM Account GROUP BY BillingState, BillingStreet` would fail to parse.

## 2.2.0

Nov 6, 2019

1. `DISTANCE` and `GEOLOCATION` functions failed to parse when used in a `WHERE` clauses and `ORDER BY` clauses.

## 2.1.0

Oct 28, 2019

1. The method signature for `getFlattenedFields` has changed to allow `Query | Subquery | FieldSubquery` to be passed in. this is not being considered a breaking change because it is fully backwards compatible.
2. A new helper method `isFieldSubquery(value: any)` was added to allow determining if a Field is a FieldSubquery. This is used internally for `getFlattenedFields()`.

## 2.0.0

Oct 6, 2019

### Summary

Version 2.0 brings some significant bundle size and performance improvements. This library now uses [Chevrotain](https://github.com/SAP/chevrotain) instead of [antlr4](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4). With this change, everything related to parsing had to be re-written from scratch. Chevrotain uses pure javascript to handle lexing, parsing, and visiting the generated ast/cst as opposed to using a grammar file and generating a javascript parser based on the grammar.

With this change, the data model was reviewed and analyzed, and there are some significant breaking changes to the data structures. Review the ðŸ”¥breaking changesðŸ”¥ below for a detailed description of each breaking change.

#### Bundle Size

To compare the bundle size, the following small program was written and then compiled using the default configuration of webpack, and the resulting webpack bundle was compared to determine the full size of the library.

Minified, uncompressed:

- Version 1.x: **545kb**
- Version 2.0: **207kb**

```javascript
var soqlParser = require('soql-parser-js');

const query = soqlParser.parseQuery(`SELECT Id FROM Account WHERE Id = 'FOO'`);
console.log('query', query);
const soql = soqlParser.composeQuery(query);
console.log('soql', soql);
```

#### Benchmarks

Performance testing was done by iterating the unit tests 60K times, here are the results:

**Version 1.x parser**

```
Library import (startup time): 0.8671 milliseconds
Parsing: 58 X 1000 = 58000 iterations.
Duration: 5.7648 seconds
Average of 0.0994 milliseconds per query
```

**Version 2.0 parser**

```
Library import (startup time): 1.3793 milliseconds
Parsing: 87 X 1000 = 87000 iterations.
Duration: 3.6582 seconds
Average of 0.0420 milliseconds per query
```

### Breaking Changes ðŸ”¥

#### General Changes

- The CLI was removed.
- The `parseQuery()` `options` have changed. The only option allowed is `allowApexBindVariables` with will allow parsing queries with apex variables.
- `rawValue` will always have a space between parameters `GROUPING(Id, BillingCountry)`
- Some `literalType` values may have differing case from prior versions, regardless of the data input.
  - `TRUE`, `FALSE`, and all functions except those listed below will always be returned in uppercase, regardless of case of input.
  - **Exceptions**:
    - `toLabel`, `convertTimezone`, `convertCurrency` will always be in camelCase.
  - Added types for `DateLiteral` and `DateNLiteral` values. If you are using TypeScript, you can utilize these types.
- A new `LiteralType` value was added for `APEX_BIND_VARIABLE`.
- When composing functions in a where clause or group by clause, the `rawValue` will be preferred (if it exists) (no change here), but if rawValue is not provided, then the function will be composed using the `functionName` and `parameters`.
- A new `LiteralType` value was added for `INTEGER_WITH_CURRENCY_PREFIX` and `DECIMAL_WITH_CURRENCY_PREFIX`. e.x. `USD500.01`

#### Compose Query

- `getComposedField()` is deprecated, you should now use `getField()`. `getComposedField()` will remain available for backward compatibility.
- `getField()`/`getComposedField()` has the following changes:
  1.  `fn` property is has been deprecated (but still exists), you should now use `functionName` instead.
  2.  The `from` property has been removed for subqueries. The `relationshipName` is required to be populated to compose a subquery.
- On the FormatOptions interface `fieldMaxLineLen` was renamed to `fieldMaxLineLength`.
- Added support for `usingScope` - https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.soql_sosl.meta/soql_sosl/sforce_api_calls_soql_select_using_scope.htm?search_text=format()
- The `having` clause condition (e.x. `left`) now uses the `Condition` interface instead of having it's own structure.

```diff
export interface FormatOptions {
  numIndent?: number;
- fieldMaxLineLen?: number;
+ fieldMaxLineLength?: number;
  fieldSubqueryParensOnOwnLine?: boolean;
  whereClauseOperatorsIndented?: boolean;
  logging?: boolean;
}
```

#### Parse Query

- `rawValue` will now be included on `Field` if `objectPrefix` is defined.
- `alias` may be included on `Field`, if defined.
- On `FieldFunctionExpression`, `fn` was renamed to `functionName`. this was done because all other usages of `fn` were `FunctionExp`, but it was a string in this case.
- The `parameters` type on `FieldFunctionExpression` was modified to allow an array of varying types.
- Removed `from` property from `FieldSubquery`.
- `having` was removed from `QueryBase` and now lives as a property on `GroupByClause`.
- On the `Condition` object, `literalType` may be an array. This will be an array if `value` is an array and there are variable types within the `value`. For example: `WHERE Foo IN ('a', null, 'b')` would produce `literalType: ['STRING', 'NULL', 'STRING']`.
- The `GroupByClause` has the following modifications:
  - `field` is now optional, and will be populated only if the grouping is on a single field.
  - `type` has been renamed to `fn` and will be populated when `CUBE` and `ROLLUP` are used.
  - The `having` clause has been added as a top-level property to the `GroupByClause` and will be populated only if a `having` clause is present.
- The `HavingCondition` interface has been removed and now uses the same `Condition` interface that the `WhereClause` uses, but without `valueQuery`.
  - The parser uses the same code to process both of these, so the `having` clause now supports the exact same capability as a `where` clause.
- `FunctionExp` has the following modifications
  - `text` was renamed to `rawValue` to be more consistent with other places in the data model.
  - `name` was renamed to `functionName`.
  - `parameter` was renamed to `parameters` and the type was changed to `(string | FunctionExp)[]` to support nested functions. This will ALWAYS be an array now even if there is only one parameter.
  - `fn` was removed, as nested functionParameters are always stored as an entry in the `parameters` array.
  - Added support for `usingScope` - https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.soql_sosl.meta/soql_sosl/sforce_api_calls_soql_select_using_scope.htm?search_text=format()

## 1.2.1

- Queries with multiple consecutive left parens in a where clause were not correctly parsed. (#69)
- Fixed npm reported security vulnerabilities.

## 1.2.0

- Changed compose methods to public to allow external access (#65)
- Fixed lodash security vulnerability
- Updated README to reflect new changes and other minor changes

## 1.1.1

- Removed files that accidentally got included with release with update of `release-it`

## 1.1.0

- Updated `Contributing.md` with more detailed instructions on grammar updates
- Added support for `WITH SECURITY_ENFORCED` (#61)

## 1.0.2

- If a field in a query happened to have a function reserved word, such as `Format`, then parsing the query failed. (#59)

## 1.0.1

- Ensured that nothing is logged directly to the console unless logging is enabled

## 1.0.0

### Changed

**!BREAKING CHANGES!**

- Added literal type information to fields to provide additional information about the field type. (#51)
  - WHERE clause fields have one of the following types `'STRING' | 'INTEGER' | 'DECIMAL' | 'BOOLEAN' | 'NULL' | 'DATE_LITERAL' | 'DATE_N_LITERAL';` stored in the condition.
  - For date literal fields that have variables, `dateLiteralVariable` will be populated with the value
- Modified Field data structure to have explicit type information. (#46, #52)
  - The data structure for fields has been modified to include specific information about the structure of a given field to ease making sense of a parsed query,
  - To aid in creating compose fields, a new helper method is available - `getComposedField()`. This takes in a simple data structure (or even a string) and will return the structure needed to compose a query.

### New

- An additional `queryUtils` object is available with the following functions:
  - `function getComposedField(input: string | ComposeFieldInput): FieldType`
  - `function getFlattenedFields(query: Query, isAggregateResult?: boolean): string[]`
  - `function isSubquery(query: Query | Subquery): query is Subquery`
  - Look at the README and refer to the unit tests for example usage.
